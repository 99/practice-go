### How to solve

 - Each folder has a README.md file and _test.go file, check it and find what kind of function you need to implement.
 - Code this function in the separate .go file inside a package and run tests. You may use anything you want except 3rd-party packages.
 - Create a PR with one .go file.
 - We will choose the most fast and elegant solution and merge into the repo within 7 days.
